# project-euler

This repository contains solutions to problems by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
All solutions are written in **Haskell**. Why? Because ~~I can~~ finally I've found a reason (pretty strange though) to learn this language.

Provided solutions are definetely not the best ones possible. They just work, nothing more.

**NOTE** If you're planning to solve these problems by yourself do not read solution before you solve the problem.
